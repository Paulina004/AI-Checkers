## Overview

This project runs a game of Checkers with two AI players. The rules for the game from the assignment's instructional guidelines is provided at the top of the p1_pdevito2019.py file. 

This project builds off the provided code given in https://github.com/Awannaphasch2016/checker_easyAI/blob/main/checker_questions.py from the repository https://github.com/Awannaphasch2016/checker_easyAI. 

The source code file that was edited by the group is now labeled as p1_pdevito2019.py. Comments of the group's names, the course name, date, and the assignment name are provided at the top of the p1_pdevito2019.py file. 

The group implemented the four functions make_move(pos), lose(), is_over(), and scoring() as shown in p1_pdevito2019.py.
